Sales and profit Margin by Categories:-
          Furniture generated moderate sales (349) with a low profit margin (2.49%).
         This indicates that while the category sells reasonably well, high cost or heavy discounts are limiting profit.
         Possibly bulky items with higher shipping or storage expenses.
         Office Supplies shows negative sales (-119.3) and a negative profit margin (-17.04%).
         This means the company is losing money in this category.
         It could be due to excessive discounting, low pricing strategy, or high operational costs.
         Needs urgent review — this segment is reducing overall profitability.
         Technology has the highest sales (452.7) but a very low profit margin (1.40%).
         This suggests high demand but low profitability per unit.
         It might be because of price competition, discounts, or costly accessories and delivery.

Sale by shipping mode , product name , region

               Standard Class shipping generated the highest sales (1,358K), while Same Day delivery had the lowest (128K). The West region showed the best profit margin (14.9%), and Canon imageCLASS 2200 led product sales.
Recommendation:
Promote faster shipping for popular products and improve sales strategies in Central and South regions.

Profit by category and region 
         Technology and Office Supplies are the most profitable categories, while Furniture shows losses in the Central region. Copiers, Paper, and Labels deliver high margins, but Tables and Bookcases result in losses.

Recommendation:
Focus on promoting high-margin subcategories like Copiers and Paper, reduce discounts on low-margin items, and review Furniture pricing and costs
